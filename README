Apache Log Parser
Created by David Caudill

This script was created to do the following:
- Read all IP addresses from a log file, determine their respective domains via reverse lookup, and output this to a textfile.
- Read from pre-existing results textfiles and update them with any and all new ip address and domain information.

This script is designed to work on any machine with Python 2.7 and I have not tested it with earlier releases.
